I hereby accept the terms of the Contributor License Agreement in the CONTRIBUTING.md file of the mempool/mempool git repository as of January 25, 2022.
I also regret having ever contributed to this repository since they keep asking me to sign this legalese timewaste things.
And finally I don't care about licenses and won't sue anyone over intellectual property, which is a fake statist construct invented by evil lobby lawyers.
