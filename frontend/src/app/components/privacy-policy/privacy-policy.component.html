      <p *ngIf="officialMempoolSpace">The <a href="https://ferritecoin.com/">ferritecoin.com</a> website, their
        associated
        API services, and related network and server infrastructure (collectively, the "Website") are operated by the
        Ferrite Foundation Ltd. ("Ferrite Space", "We", or "Us").</p>

      <p *ngIf="!officialMempoolSpace">This website and its API service (collectively, the "Website") are operated by a
        member of the Ferrite community ("We" or "Us"). Ferrite Foundation Ltd. ("Ferrite Space") has no affiliation
        with
        the operator of this Website, and does not sponsor or endorse the information provided herein.</p>

      <h5>By accessing this Website, you agree to the following Privacy Policy:</h5>

      <br>

      <h4>TRUSTED THIRD PARTIES ARE SECURITY HOLES</h4>

      <p>Out of respect for the Ferrite community, this website does not use any third-party analytics, third-party
        trackers, or third-party cookies, and we do not share any private user data with third-parties. Additionally, to
        mitigate the risk of surveillance by malicious third-parties, we self-host this website on our own hardware and
        network infrastructure, so there are no "hosting companies" or "cloud providers" involved with the operation of
        this website.</p>

      <br>

      <h4>TRUSTED FIRST PARTIES ARE ALSO SECURITY HOLES</h4>

      <p>Out of respect for the Ferrite community, this website does not use any first-party cookies, except to store
        your preferred language setting (if any). However, we do use minimal first-party analytics and logging as needed
        for the operation of this website, as follows:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>We use basic webserver logging (nginx) for sysadmin purposes, which collects your IP address along with the
          requests you make. These logs are deleted after 10 days, and we do not share this data with any third-party.
          To conceal your IP address from our webserver logs, we recommend that you use Tor Browser with our Tor v3
          hidden service onion hostname.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <h4>TRUST YOUR OWN SELF-HOSTED Ferrite Space EXPLORER</h4>

      <p>For maximum privacy, we recommend that you use your own self-hosted instance of the Ferrite Space explorer on
        your
        own hardware. You can easily install your own self-hosted instance of this website on a Raspberry Pi using a
        one-click installation method maintained by various Ferrite fullnode distributions such as Umbrel. See our
        project's GitHub page for more details about self-hosting this website.</p>
