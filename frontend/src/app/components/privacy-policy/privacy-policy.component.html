        associated
        API services, and related network and server infrastructure (collectively, the "Website") are operated by ferritecoin.com ("Ferritecoin", "We", or "Us").</p>

      <p *ngIf="!officialMempoolSpace">This website and its API service (collectively, the "Website") are operated by a
        member of the Ferrite community ("We" or "Us"). ferritecoin.com ("Ferritecoin") has no affiliation
        with
        the operator of this Website, and does not sponsor or endorse the information provided herein.</p>

      <h5>By accessing this Website, you agree to the following Privacy Policy:</h5>

      <br>

      <h4>TRUSTED THIRD PARTIES ARE SECURITY HOLES</h4>

      <p>We prioritize the privacy and security of our Ferrite community members. 
	Therefore, this website does not utilize third-party analytics, trackers, or cookies. 
	We also do not share any private user data with third parties.
	To further safeguard against potential surveillance by malicious entities, 
	we self-host this website on our own hardware and network infrastructure. 
	This means no external hosting companies or cloud providers are involved in the operation of this website.</p>

      <br>

      <h4>TRUSTED FIRST PARTIES ARE ALSO SECURITY HOLES</h4>

      <p>In respect for the Ferrite community, 
	this website does not use any first-party cookies, 
	except to store your preferred language setting (if any). 
	However, we do employ minimal first-party analytics and logging as necessary for the operation of this website:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>We utilize basic webserver logging (nginx) for system administration purposes, 
	which includes collecting your IP address along with the requests you make. 
	These logs are deleted after 10 days, and we do not share this data with any third parties. 
	To conceal your IP address from our webserver logs, 
	we recommend using the Tor Browser with our Tor v3 hidden service onion hostname.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <h4>TRUST YOUR OWN SELF-HOSTED Ferrite Space EXPLORER</h4>

      <p>For maximum privacy, we recommend using your own self-hosted instance of the Ferrite Space explorer on your own hardware. 
	You can easily install your own self-hosted instance of this website on a Raspberry Pi 
	using a one-click installation method maintained by various Ferrite fullnode distributions. 
	Please visit our project's GitHub page for more details about self-hosting this website.</p>
